Collective Variables
====================

Collective variables (CVs) are arbitrary differentiable functions of the
:math:`3N` Cartesian coordinates of the atoms in a simulation. These
usually represent some structurally, thermodynamically, or chemically
meaningful quantity along which advanced sampling can be performed. Listed
below are the collective variables currently supported in SSAGES, along with a
brief description and information on how the syntax is implemented in SSAGES.
In addition to specific properties for each CV, a name property may be
defined for any CV which is used to reference the CV within the methods of SSAGES.

.. code-block:: javascript

	"name" : "mycvname"

The name specified for a CV must be unique. It is possible, however, to omit
this and simply reference a CV by its numerical index.

.. note::

	We tacitly assume we are working with spherical atoms that join together to form molecules.

Angle
-----

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This CV calculates the bend angle, in radians, formed between three selected atoms :math:`i,j,k`,

.. math::

	\xi = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathbf{r}_{ij} \cdot \mathbf{r}_{kj}}{\Vert \mathbf{r}_{ij} \Vert \Vert \mathbf{r}_{kj} \Vert} \right).

This can be helpful when probing the conformations of a molecule to understand its stable and metastable states. Angles do not have to be defined between bonded atoms.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
		"type" : "Angle",
		"atom_ids" : [0, 1, 2]
	}

.. warning::

	The angle must be between three individual particles rather than the centers-of-mass of particle groups.

Options & Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Required
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

	"type"

Property ``type`` must be set to string ``"Angle"``.


.. code-block:: javascript

	"atom_ids"

Property ``atom_ids`` must contain three integers consisting of the atom ID forming the angle of interest.

ANNCV
-----

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This CV takes scaled (specified by ``scaling_factor``) Cartesian coordinates of a group of atoms (specified by ``atomids``) as inputs to a neural network (its number of nodes, connection weights, and activation functions are specified by ``num_nodes``, ``coeff_file``, ``activations``, respectively), computes one component (specified by ``out_index``) of the final neural network outputs as the CV value. The coefficients of the neural network can be obtained from any feed-forward neural networks trained with Cartesian coordinates as inputs.  Examples of the neural networks include the encoders of the autoencoders in the `MESA framework <https://github.com/weiHelloWorld/accelerated_sampling_with_autoencoder>`_, or `State-free Reversible VAMPnets <https://github.com/hsidky/srv>`_.

In the following example, we define an ANN CV which takes Cartesian coordinates of atoms ``[2, 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 19]``, scaled by factor 0.5, as inputs to a neural network with node numbers ``[21, 40, 2]`` and activation functions ``["Tanh", "Tanh"]``, and weights defined in file ``autoencoder_info_1.txt`` (which stores weights for the neural network), and outputs two components (marked as index 0 and 1) as CVs.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: javascript

	"CVs": [
				{
					"type": "ANNCV",
					"atom_ids": [2, 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 19],

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

gyration tensor of a group of :math:`N` atoms defined as,

.. math::

	\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}{m_i}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{m_i \left( \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{COM}\right) \otimes \left( \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_\mathrm{COM}\right)}

where :math:`m_i` is the mass and :math:`\mathbf{r}_i` is the vector of
coordinates of the :math:`i^{\mathrm{th}}` atom, :math:`\mathbf{r}_\mathrm{COM}`

long polymer) or the shape of a given assembly of molecules. With eigenvalues
of :math:`\lambda_x^2,~\lambda_y^2,~\lambda_z^2` (in increasing order)
defined in the frame of the principal axes of inertia,
the following quantities may be computed:

Pairwise
--------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This CV calculates a variety of pairwise properties. The functions (kernels) used are continous analogs for otherwise discontinuous CVs. If parameters are chosen judiciously, these kernels can be used in place of some standard, discontinuous CVs. A Gaussian kernel can emulate a count of nearest neighbors; a switching function kernel can emulate a coordination number.

.. math::

where :math:`f_{ij}` is a pairwise function for atoms :math:`i` and :math:`j`. are at a distance of the center of the Gaussian, :math:`r_{ij}=\mu`, and decreases to zero as the distance deviates away from :math:`\mu`.

Example
^^^^^^^

This example uses a Gaussian pairwise kernel to compute contributions from contact-type interactions between two atoms of size 1.0.

.. code-block:: javascript
	
	{
		"type" : "Pairwise",
		"group1" : [1, 5],
		"group2" : [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8],

Pairwise Kernels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gaussian Function
*****************

The Gaussian function is defined as:

.. math::

	g_{ij} = e^{-\frac{\left(r_{ij} - \mu\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}}.

This type of kernel is useful to select between conformations which have a different position of (e.g.) neighbors and next nearest neighbors in a particle cluster. Selection of particle separations approximates a math:`\delta` distribution.

Properties
++++++++++

	"mu"

Property ``mu`` is required and must be numeric.

.. code-block:: javascript
	
	"sigma"

.. math::

	s_{ij} = \frac{1-\left(\frac{r_{ij} - d_0}{r_0}\right)^n}{1-\left(\frac{r_{ij} - d_0}{r_0}\right)^m}.

This quantity is useful for measuring how many atoms in group 2 occupy a spherical shell around atoms in group 1. The form is chosen so that the variable is continuous and differentiable. Through tuning :math:`n` and :math:`m` this can be made arbitrarily close to a Heaviside switching function.

.. math::

    X_p = \sqrt{\mathbf{X}_p\cdot\mathbf{X}_p},

with the :math: `p` th Rouse mode defined as

Specifically, the function ``atan2`` is used for the inverse tangent calculation to yield a four-quadrant angle.

.. warning::

	The torsional angle can only be defined between four atoms rather than four groups of atoms.

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
		"type" : "Torsional",
		"atom_ids" : [1, 5, 6, 10]
	}

Alpha Helix RMSD
----------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This CV calculates alpha helix character by comparision to an "ideal" alpha

.. math::

	\xi = \sum_i \frac{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{0.1\text{ nm}}\right)^8}{1 - (\frac{r_i}{0.1\text{ nm}})^{12}}

where :math:`r_i` is the pairwise RMSD calculated between the backbone atoms in
the 6 amino acid sequence and the ideal reference structure. 5 backbone atoms
are used for each amino acid, so each pairwise RMSD is calculated between two
sets of 30 atoms. In the case of glycine, the HA1 atom is used in place of CB
backbone atom.

.. note::

	Note that this CV is basically a summation of switching functions applied to the RMSD rather than to coordinates; in future versions, the user will be able to choose custom parameters for the switching function.

.. note::

	Unlike the simpler CVs discussed above, this one takes atomic labels in the form of a reference PDB structure. This is true of all protein-like CVs below which compare to a reference structure.

.. warning::

	Since the definition of this CV uses nanometers as a unit length, you must specify the ``unitconv`` parameter, as outlined below, in order to apply this CV when that is not the base unit of length.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
            "type" : "AlphaRMSD",
            "residue_ids" : [3, 21],

Property ``residue_ids`` must be an array of two integers designating the range
of amino acids for which to calculate the CV. The indices of the amino acids
must match those from the reference structure provided in the property
``reference``. The smaller index must be listed first, and the range must span
at least 6 amino acids.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "reference"

Property ``reference`` must be a string containing the name of a reference pdb
structure. This reference pdb structure is used along with the residue range
defined in ``residue_ids`` to check for alpha helix character. For now, all
residues in the system must be numbered in increasing order, even if they belong
to separate chains. For example, if your system has two chains of 20 amino acids
each, the first amino acid in the second chain should be numbered 21.

Optional
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

    "unitconv"

Property ``unitconv`` must be numeric. This factor is used to reconcile the
internal MD units for your engine and the units used in the ideal alpha helix
reference structure. If your engine uses units of nanometers, this
can be ignored. Otherwise, ``unitconv`` must be set to the equivalent number of
length units in your MD engine equal to 1 nm. For example, if your default unit
length is in angstroms, ``unitconv`` will be set to 10.

Anti Beta RMSD
----------------

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

This CV calculates anti beta-sheet character by comparision to an "ideal" anti
beta-sheet structure composed of 6 amino acids. This is computed by performing a
summation over all possible sequences of 6 amino acids, consisting of two
segments of 3 consecutive amino acids each, in the region of interest.

.. math::

	\xi = \sum_i \frac{1 - \left(\frac{r_i}{0.1\text{ nm}}\right)^8}{1 - (\frac{r_i}{0.1\text{ nm}})^{12}}

where :math:`r_i` is the pairwise RMSD calculated between the backbone atoms in
the 6 amino acid sequence and the ideal reference structure. 5 backbone atoms

	Unlike the simpler CVs discussed above, this one takes atomic labels in the form of a reference PDB structure. This is true of all protein-like CVs below which compare to a reference structure.

.. warning::

	Since the definition of this CV uses nanometers as a unit length, you must specify the ``unitconv`` parameter, as outlined below, in order to apply this CV when that is not the base unit of length.

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: javascript

	{
		"type" : "ParallelBetaRMSD",
		"residue_ids" : [3, 21],
		"reference" : "reference_structure.pdb",
		"unitconv" : 10,
		"mode" : 0
	}

Options & Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Required
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

	"type"

Property ``type`` must be set to string ``"ParallelBetaRMSD"``.

.. code-block:: javascript

	"residue_ids"

Property ``residue_ids`` must be an array of two integers designating the range
of amino acids for which to calculate the CV. The indices of the amino acids
must match those from the reference structure provided in the property
``reference``. The smaller index must be listed first, and the range must span
at least 6 amino acids.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "reference"

Property ``reference`` must be a string containing the name of a reference pdb
structure. This reference pdb structure is used along with the residue range
defined in ``residue_ids`` to check for parallel beta-sheet character. For now,
all residues in the system must be numbered in increasing order, even if they
belong to separate chains. For example, if your system has two chains of 20
amino acids each, the first amino acid in the second chain should be numbered
21.

Optional
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: javascript

    "unitconv"

Property ``unitconv`` must be numeric. This factor is used to reconcile the
internal MD units for your engine and the units used in the ideal parallel
beta-sheet reference structure. If your engine uses units of nanometers, this
can be ignored. Otherwise, ``unitconv`` must be set to the equivalent number of
length units in your MD engine equal to 1 nm. For example, if your default unit
length is in angstroms, ``unitconv`` will be set to 10.

.. code-block:: javascript

    "mode"

Property ``mode`` is an integer specifying whether to calculate beta-sheets
formed only between residues on the same chain (intra) or only between residues
on separate chains (inter). If ``mode`` is set to 0, both modes will be used.
A value of 1 selects for the intra mode; a value of 2 selects for inter mode.
