Umbrella Sampling
-----------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calculations of thermodynamic data and other properties rely on proper sampling of the configurational space.
However, the presence of energy barriers can prevent certain configurations from being sampled properly or even sampled at
all. Umbrella sampling is a simulation technique that helps to overcome those barriers and improve sampling
by applying a bias along a specified collective variable. The bias takes the form of a harmonic potential and is typically constant throughout a simulation.
Usually, a series of umbrella-sampled simulations are performed and analyzed together using the weighted histogram analysis method
(WHAM) :cite:`KUMAR19921011`.

The functional form of the artificial bias is

.. math::

	U_\text{umbrella} = \frac{1}{2} k \left(\xi - \xi_0\right)^2

where :math:`k` is the spring constant, :math:`\xi` is the current value of the collective variable and :math:`\xi_0` is the desired value of the collective variable.
The success of the umbrella sampling method depends on the correct choice of :math:`k` and :math:`\xi_0` for the different simulations. Suitable values of :math:`k` and :math:`\xi_0` depend on the distances between adjacent umbrellas, and the gradient of the free energy surface at :math:`\xi_0`.

For more information about the umbrella sampling method, the interested reader is referred to Ref. :cite:`KASTNER2011932`.

Options & Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following parameters need to be set under ``"method"`` in the JSON input file:

.. code-block:: javascript

	"type" : "Umbrella"

The following options are available for Umbrella Sampling:

centers (required)
	Array of target values for each CV. This can either be an array of numbers, or
	an array of an array of numbers, for multiple walkers. If only a single array is
	defined, it is used across all walkers.

ksprings (required)
	Array of spring constants for each CV. This can either be an array of numbers, or
	an array of an array of numbers, for multiple walkers. If only a single array is
	defined, it is used across all walkers.

output_file (required)
	Output file name for umbrella sampling data. This can be a string or
	an array of strings for multiple walkers.

output_frequency (optional)
	Frequency of writing to output file. (Default: 1)

append (optional)
	Boolean value which will cause umbrella sampling to either append to
	an existing file or override it entirely. (Default: ``false``)

The umbrella sampling method can also be run with time dependent centers.
This is equivalent to the "steered MD" method. To do so, omit ``"centers"``
and use the following options instead:

centers0 (required)
	Array of initial target values for each CV. This can either be an array of numbers, or
	an array of an array of numbers, for multiple walkers. If only a single array is
	defined, it is used across all walkers.

centers1 (required)
	Array of final target values for each CV. This can either be an array of numbers, or
	an array of an array of numbers, for multiple walkers. If only a single array is
	defined, it is used across all walkers.

timesteps (required)
	The number of timesteps over which to scale the umbrella centers

By setting the above options, the umbrella method will linearly interpolate
between ``centers0`` and ``centers1`` in ``timesteps`` iterations.

LAMMPS Tutorial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial will go through running Umbrella Sampling on an atomistic model
of butane using LAMMPS as the MD engine.
Umbrella sampling will be performed on the torsional CV of the butane C atoms.

The butane implementation in LAMMPS requires several modules to be added
before being linked to SSAGES.
To do this, return to your build directory and issue the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

	make yes-molecule
	make yes-kspace
	make

which add the ``MOLECULE`` and ``KSPACE`` LAMMPS packages.
For more information on optional packages for LAMMPS, refer to
the `LAMMPS User Manual <https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Packages.html>`_.

The files for running this example can
be found in ``Examples/User/Umbrella/LAMMPS`` and consist of the following files:

``Butane_SSAGES.in``
	LAMMPS input file

``Butane.data``
	LAMMPS data file describing butane molecule.

``umbrella_input.json``
	Template JSON input containing information for one Umbrella Sampling simulation.

``umbrella_multiwalker_gen.py``
	Python script for creating ``multiwalker_umbrella.json`` input file. The total number of
	simulations and the ``centers`` values are controlled in this file.

Once in the directory, the appropriate ``.json`` file needs to be generated. A ``.json`` file
is already in the directory, ``umbrella_input.json``, which contains the CV information
and specifies the LAMMPS input files to be used. A single-walker umbrella simulation can
be run directly using

.. code-block:: bash

	ssages umbrella_input.json

The simulation will create an output file named ``umbrella.dat1`` containing the value of
the CV and the target value (the center) every 100 timesteps. From this histogram, the
local free energy can be calculated.

While it is possible to run Umbrella Sampling using a single walker, typically multiple
walkers (multiple umbrellas) are simulated. To run multiwalker Umbrella Sampling of butane,
you can generate an input file using the ``umbrella_multiwalker_gen.py`` script via

.. code-block:: bash

	python umbrella_multiwalker_gen.py

This will generate an input file called ``multiwalker_umbrella.json`` containing the
information from ``umbrella_input.json`` duplicated 12 times with varying values of
``centers``. These values correspond to the target values of the torsional CV.

To run multiwalker SSAGES issue the command:

.. code-block:: bash

	mpiexec -np 12 /path/to/SSAGES/build/ssages multiwaler_umbrella.json

This will run 12 different umbrella sampling simulations simultaneously.
Ideally, this example will be run in computing environment where each process can run
on a different processor. The example will still work if run on a users local desktop
or laptop machine, but the runtime of the code will be very large.

During the simulation 12 different output files will be generated, each containing the
iteration, target value of the corresponding 'center' CV, and the value of the CV at
the iteration number.

These output files can then be used to construct a complete free energy surface using
the WHAM algorithm :cite:`KUMAR19921011`. Though SSAGES does not currently contain its own implementation
of WHAM, there are many implementations available, such as that provided by the
Grossfield Lab :cite:`WHAM`.

HOOMD-blue Tutorial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example uses the HOOMD-blue engine to run parallel simulations of a butane molecule.
The free energy is measured as a function of the dihedral angle between the terminal carbons.
The butane molecule has a backbone of four carbon atoms that `rotates into different conformations <https://chem.libretexts.org/Textbook_Maps/Organic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Organic_Chemistry)/Chirality/Stereoisomers/Butane_Conformers>`_ (*anti*, *gauche*, and *eclipsed*).
We wish to extract the free energy of this rotation, to know the energy cost of any angle between -180 degrees and 180 degrees.

This example uses Umbrella Sampling with the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).
The WHAM tool developed by Alan Grossfield :cite:`WHAM` is used to determine the free energy from the biased sampling we perform.
Disclaimer: The parameters of this simulation (number of walkers, strength of bias potential springs, length of run, etc.) may not provide ideal sampling for this example problem, and improvements to this code are welcomed.

The files for running this example can be found in ``Examples/User/Umbrella/HOOMD``.

Sample output files from this example code are in the ``Examples/User/Umbrella/HOOMD/sample_outputs`` folder.

**Running the Example Script:**

1. Modify HOOMD-blue script: Set desired parameters (e.g. ``kT``) in ``Butane_SSAGES.py``

2. Modify input generator: Set the parameters in ``umbrella_multiwalker_gen.py`` and ``umbrella_input.json``. Important parameters:

``umbrella_multiwalker_gen.py``:

	* ``nwalkers`` is the number of walkers, determining how many independent simulations will be run.

``umbrella_input.json``:

	* ``ksprings`` gives the bias potential spring strength.
	* ``hoomd_steps`` changes the length of the run.

	Most of the other parameters are used to define the system and collective variables and should not be changed.

3. Generate inputs:

.. code-block:: bash

	python umbrella_multiwalker_gen.py

4. Run SSAGES, replacing "nwalker" with the number of walkers specified previously:

.. code-block:: bash

	mpiexec -np nwalker /path/to/SSAGES/build/ssages multiwalker_umbrella_input.json

5. Analyze data:

	Download the WHAM code available here :cite:`WHAM`.
	Compile the program using the instructions and documentation provided.
	It is recommended to read `this talk about the theory and practice of WHAM <http://membrane.urmc.rochester.edu/sites/default/files/wham/wham_talk.pdf>`_.

	a) Call wham: The script ``wham_analysis.sh`` contains a set of parameters for calling ``wham``.
		This requires that the executable ``wham`` is in this directory.

	.. code-block:: bash

		./wham_analysis.sh

	b) Run visualization script:

	.. code-block:: bash

		python wham_visualization.py

	The script ``wham_visualization.py`` will read the output data files from SSAGES and the ``wham`` software to produce sets of figures similar to those in the talk linked above.
	The visualization outputs include:

	* ``cv_vs_time.png`` plots the collective variable (dihedral angle) over
	  time. This helps check that enough autocorrelation times have passed.
	* ``histogram_trajectories.png`` shows a histogram from each of the
	  trajectories and the regions of the CV that were sampled.
	* ``histogram_combined.png`` shows a histogram summed over all trajectories
	  to ensure that the entire range of angles were sampled.
	* ``wham_free_energy.png`` is the free energy as a function of the dihedral
	  angle.
