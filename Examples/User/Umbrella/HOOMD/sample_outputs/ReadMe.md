This folder contains sample outputs from the SSAGES HOOMD-blue Umbrella Sampling example code.

`cv_vs_time.png` plots the collective variable (dihedral angle) over time. This helps check that enough autocorrelation times have passed.

![CV vs Time](cv_vs_time.png "CV vs Time")

`histogram_trajectories.png` shows a histogram from each of the trajectories and the regions of the CV that were sampled.

![Histogram Trajectories](histogram_trajectories.png "Histogram Trajectories")

`histogram_combined.png` shows a histogram summed over all trajectories to ensure that the entire range of angles were sampled.

![Histograms Combined](histogram_combined.png "Histograms Combined")

`wham_free_energy.png` is the free energy as a function of the dihedral angle.
